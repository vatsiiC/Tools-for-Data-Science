# - Python
# - R
# - SQL
# - Julia
# - Scala
# 

# ## Data Science Libraries
# 
# - **Python Libraries**:
#   - NumPy
#   - Pandas
#   - Matplotlib
#   - Seaborn
#   - Scikit-learn
#   - TensorFlow
#   - PyTorch
# 
# - **R Libraries**:
#   - ggplot2
#   - dplyr
#   - tidyr

# 

# ## Arithmetic Expression Examples
# 
# In this section, we will demonstrate basic arithmetic operations such as multiplication and addition.
# 

# In[9]:


# Multiplication and Addition
num1 = 5
num2 = 10

# Multiplication
product = num1 * num2

# Addition
sum_result = num1 + num2

product, sum_result


# In[10]:


# Convert Minutes to Hours
def convert_minutes_to_hours(minutes):
    hours = minutes / 60
    return hours

# Example conversion
minutes = 120
hours = convert_minutes_to_hours(minutes)
hours


# ## Objectives
# 
# - To understand and list data science languages and libraries.
# - To identify and describe key data science tools.
# - To practice basic arithmetic operations in Python.
# - To perform unit conversion for practical applications.
