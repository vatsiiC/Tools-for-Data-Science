# Tools-for-Data-Science
This course introduced us to multiple data science tools, and in this final project, we will use Jupyterlite Notebook, one of the easiest tools to share publicly. We will create your Jupyterlite Notebook and share it via a public GitHub link. We will need to include a combination of markdown and code cells.
